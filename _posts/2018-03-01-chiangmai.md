title: Chiang Mai (Part 2)
---


After Chiang Rai we returned to Chiang Mai looking to have some down time to get ready
for our trip to Myanmar. First we spent a week east of the Old City, and then
we spent a few days on the west side of Chiang Mai, closer to the airport.

Our east side stay was at a homey Airbnb 2-story two bedroom house on a quiet
street. All to ourselves with a very stocked kitchen we did plenty of cooking
and it was a taste of a “normal” life — or maybe normal Western lifestyle. We
kept it pretty simple and didn’t do too much, mostly exploring some local spots,
parks, river walks, a remote resort where you could pay to use the pool. Then we
packed up and moved to the next spot.

## Rajapruek

Actually before we went to Chiang Rai, we had spent a week in the western part
of Chiang Mai, between the mountains and the airport. During that stay we learned
about the nearby [Royal Park Rajapruek](http://www.royalparkrajapruek.org/).
The park has a simple hotel on one side, and if you stay there you get free
tickets to the park. So that’s where we spent a few days.

It’s a very large park (~200 acres), and doesn’t seem to be widely known because
it’s a bit far from central Chiang Mai. Part of it is much like a botanical
garden, with flower gardens (a famous orchid garden, this is the main reason people come to Rajapruek),
a giant heirloom tomato trellis tunnel, and lot of stuff for curious kids. There also lots of
agricultural projects nearby, and some of that is sold at their on-site produce
store.

The gardens also have an international pavilion. These are a collection of
self-contained gardens, each one created in the style of (or inspired by) a
country — Kenya, Myanmar, Vietnam, China, Qatar, etc. —  about 30 altogether.
These mini gardens serve as a prelude to the large royal Thai pavilion, a
reminder that the entire park was built in the honor of (now deceased) king in
2006.
