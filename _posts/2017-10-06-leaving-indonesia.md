title: Leaving Indonesia
---


It was time to say *selamat tinggal* (goodbye) to Indonesia. I will always remember and miss the foods and the kind openness of people eager to talk. I will remember the smoke everywhere: burning trash, sizzling sate (satay), tobacco, exhaust fumes and incense.

We learned so much, though we saw only a small part of the expansive country.

## Quick stats
* 3 months (with a 1 week visa run to Kuala Lumpur)
* 8 accommodations: 5 guest houses, 3 homestays
* 7 places: Canggu, Ubud, and briefly in Munduk in Bali; Borobudur and Yogya in Java; Bukittingi and Maninjau in Sumatra
* 4 airports: Denpasar, Yogyakarta, Jakarta, and Padang
