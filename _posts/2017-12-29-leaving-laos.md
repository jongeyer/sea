*Haw Pha Bang, royal temple monument*

We saw very little of Laos, and spent a relatively short time there. But it felt that we saw the best it could offer, a balance of accessibility and cultural exposure. I took more pictures in Luang Prabang than in Phuket, Chiang Mai and Sukhothai combined. So it really seemed to us that we packed in a lot of experiences.


## Quick stats
* 2 weeks
* 2 guesthouse accomodations
* 1 place: Luang Prabang
