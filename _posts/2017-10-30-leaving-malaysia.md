title: Leaving Malaysia
---


Though, it was not a very long time, it was time to say *selamat tinggal* (goodbye in Malaysia Bahasa, same as Indonesian) to Malaysia, and *sà wàt dii kráp* (hello, in Thai). Though I won’t miss the oppressive heat or mosquitoes, I was really glad to spend some time exploring the place calling itself the ’essence of Asia’. It was time for a new place, nearby but very different.

## Quick stats
* 3 weeks
* 8 accommodations: 1 apartment, 2 guest houses, 1 homestay
* 2 places: Kuala Lumpur; George Town and Ayer Itam in Penang
* 2 airports: Kuala Lumpur and Phuket (also a train and ferry)
