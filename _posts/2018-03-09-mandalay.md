title: Mandalay, Myanmar
---


What is the place, this name Mandalay I’ve heard so many times and know nothing
about?

We arrived in Myanmar (formerly known as Burma) at the Mandalay airport, boarded
a bus and endured a bumpy 45 mins drive to our hotel. Our hotel was quite nice
but near the train station that was under regular construction. The trains
occasionally trickled by, and like everything else that moves, they kick up the
dust that coated the streets everywhere. All along the construction site a
shanty town was built up with families cooking food over fires and young
children running around half naked.

Mandalay is the biggest city in the northern half of Myanmar, with a population
around 1.5 million, it feels big and small at the same time. It’s a sprawling
city with large city blocks and few buildings above 15 stories. The haze of dust
and smoke hangs suspended over the city, and I wonder if it’s always like this?

We kept seeing the same tourists here and there, but maybe that’s because
tourism in Myanmar is somewhat restrictive. To receive a tourist visa you are
required to find accommodation at a registered hotel, at least at first — so
airbnb is not so popular.

## Burmese

Like many places on our journey, everything seemed a little different at first,
or at least surprisingly different from neighboring Thailand. There is a 30-min
time difference — who does that? Most men where [longyi
(*lon-jee*)](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Longyi), like sarongs for men just as
we saw in Bali. The Burmese written language looks quite different from Thai,
although it actually looks related to the old script language you see in some
old Thai temples ([Lanna script](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Tai_Tham_alphabet)) —
lots of circular characters.

Betel nut is chewed and spat everywhere. It stains the streets and sidewalks as
well as people’s teeth. I’ve read that like nicotine it works like a mild
stimulant and also is terrible for everything in your mouth. So I can
imagine why it has been banned in some countries and discouraged in many others
although there are exceptions made for traditional cultural practices. Because
betel nut has a traditional connection to almost all cultures across Southeast Asia.

Another thing you will notice immediately are peoples faces covered with chalky
beige paste. This is [*thanaka*](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Thanaka). For
thousands of years the Burmese takes branches from thanaka trees, and rub cuts
of it with water over a special grinding stone producing a paste to smear on the
face — mostly cheeks and foreheads of women, girls and some young boys. Why? —
it’s supposed to be a good sunblock and for a little while it offers a cooling
sensation. We saw the thanaka wood cuts sold all over Myanmar, from local
markets to streets vendors marketing to tourists.

## Mandalay Palace

In the northern area of Mandalay is the massive 2 square kilometer moat-lined
citadel which houses [Mandalay
Palace](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Mandalay_Palace). The palace, initially
constructed in the mid-19th century, did not appear to be well maintained.
That’s in part because only a few decades after it was built the British
invaded, colonized Burma and repurposed the whole citadel as a military fort.
Later during World War II the Japanese occupied the citadel as a supply depot
and which meant it was target for allied bombing. Most of the palace was lost
and only restoration efforts only began in 1989.

The compound grounds (the part within the moat but outside the inner palace
grounds) is still protected for military functions and most of it is off limits.
Though rebuilt with non-traditional materials, the palace had unique touches
that referenced the styles of a mostly forgotten royal history in Myanmar.

## Min Kun

Take a boat a half hour ride from Mandalay up the Ayeyarwady River (or
Irrawaddy) and you will see a enormous almost cubic stupa rising on the horizon.
The stupa is located in Min Kun (or
[Mingun](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Mingun)), a small town with a number of
famous Buddhist monuments. The brick stupa was built in the late 18th century
and if completed would have been the largest in the world. Since then it has
suffered the effects of many large and small earthquakes leaving the stupa
cracked and toppled in many places.

Min Kun is also known for having the largest functional working bell in the
world. Standing in front of it you have no idea of this, since there was no sign
visible to claim this title but we were informed by a very friendly guide that
we hired for the hour or so that we roamed around the town. After the bell we
visited some pagodas and before returning to the boat passed by two giant lion
statues on the river front — also victims of the earthquakes the intended forms
were fairly unrecognizable.

## U Bein Bridge and Mandalay Hill

In the two weeks that we spent in the country we saw almost no clouds, few
mountains and a handful of tall buildings, so we almost always had a clear view
of the horizon for sunsets. But never once did we see the sun touch the horizon —
before that it would always dim and fade away into the dusty haze. Still there
some good sunset spots near Mandalay.

Mandalay Hill north of the city (the city is actually named after the hill) has
historically had some important pagodas and monasteries making it an important
pilgrimage site. We only went to the main temple site at the peak, Sutaungpyei
Pagoda, to enjoy the sunset with the crowds.

[U Bein Bridge](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/U_Bein_Bridge) that spans a shallow
(unless its rainy season) lake that connects Amarapura, a former royal capital
of Myanmar, to the east, away from the floods of Ayeyarwady. The 1.2 km teak
wood bridge attracts lots of visitors (foreign and local) and provided a
picturesque setting to our last day in Mandalay before we took off for Bagan.
