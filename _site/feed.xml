We didn’t venture to any of the many universities, but we did see many young people in central Yogya where we were staying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city is also the capital of the Special Region of Yogyakarta — special, because it has a sultan. The sultanate existed apparently since prehistory, and survived the waves of European colonization and Indonesian independence. When independence was declared, the Sultan expressed his allegiance and in return was granted a special status. We visited the Sultan’s palace, a large estate suffering in disrepair, but preserving some interesting elements of history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yogya is a big city, with few visible Western tourists. Although more walkable than much of Bali, the city center is full of exhaust fumes hovering in the hot air. We walked the main thoroughfare (Jalan Malioboro) down to the local market area, which is absolutely packed with hundreds or thousands of vendors mostly selling batik clothing or other clothing. After some hours it’s dizzying to take in all the patterns, materials, of different sizes and purposes, etc. The true central market is a maze of stalls stocked from floor to ceiling in endless batiks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent two evenings enjoying traditional Javanese theater. The first, Ramayana Ballet, overpriced and of mediocre quality was nevertheless intriguing. The same Ramayana story presented in the reliefs of Prambanan. The second, traditional puppet theater, also telling the story of Ramayana. The puppet theater was underpriced and quite enjoyable. The performance is led by a single puppeteer who sets the pace for the ensemble of musicians to follow. The puppeteer also has some musical methods to control the tension of the scene (like tapping a wooden box, or using one of his feet to chime a cymbal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The puppet performance had a curious mix of the serious focus of a sacred ritual and the casual atmosphere of performing with friends. Some of the musicians waved at Asa, and one invited a young woman to sit and play the instrument with him. This kind of mixed atmosphere was one I had seen in many performances through out Indonesia. Overall, it made things more enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Aerial shot of Borobudur&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our 3rd day in Borobudur we visited the temple (Candi), which is why the town exists. The temple has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Borobudur&quot;&gt;a fascinating history&lt;/a&gt; and is the largest Buddhist temple in the world, despite being located for many centuries in a region that is predominantly Muslim with virtually no Buddhists. At the time of its construction in the 9th century, Buddhists and Hindus were coexisting in central Java with some degree of harmony. (Candi Prambanan, we visited on the next day, is largest Hindu temple in Indonesia, built around the same time and only 50 km away). When a volcano erupts, the Javanese have the custom to pack up and pick a different place to live (seems like common sense); this happened in the 10th century so they abandoned Borobudur and Prambanan (both covered in volcanic ash and toppled) and settled mostly in Eastern Java to build new temples and start over. In the 19th century both sites were “rediscovered”, thus gaining international attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sea/assets/img-java/borobudur.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stonework at Borobudur&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Stonework at Borobudur&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Borobudur temple, has 9 levels, constructed like a step pyramid. These levels are broken into sections representing realms of Buddhist cosmology, and 1,460 relief sections surrounding the levels tell stories of the stages of the Buddha’s spiritual development to enlightenment. Aside from the reliefs, the temple has 504 life-size statues of Buddha geometrically arranged, and those on top veiled in stupas. Truly an impressive sight, and difficult to capture with my camera. Much work has been done to restore the structure, and the reliefs and other stonework have retained a lot of detail over a millennia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Example of relief at Borobudur&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the morning grew late, the sun was more intense and the tourists and visitors packed in tighter. In spite of its Buddhist symbolism, Borobudur is a revered as a source of pride for all Indonesians. We saw many Indonesians school groups flood the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Prambanan&quot;&gt;Prambanan temple&lt;/a&gt; was our stop on the next day, on our way to our next guest house in Yogyakarta. The biggest Hindu temple in Indonesia, Prambanan was also quite impressive. In contrast to the singular structure of Borobudur (and it’s “non-theistic” Buddhist values), Prambanan is a temple compound of several related temples, mainly to the principal Hindu gods, Shiva (destroyer), Brahma (creator) and Vishnu (preserver). Inside each temple was one or more cave-like rooms, each with a statue inside representing the god or lesser gods in relation. The complex of temples is meant to represent the layers of Hindu cosmology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sea/assets/img-java/prambanan-statue.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Prambanan Statue&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Prambanan chamber Ganesha statue&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While based on different fundamental ideas, there seemed to be many similarities to Borobudur temple. There were reliefs around each temple, collectively telling the story of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Ramayana&quot;&gt;Ramayana&lt;/a&gt; especially important in Indonesia and throughout Southeast Asia. Shapes and stone carving styles seemed quite similar as well. I enjoyed just examining the details and textures of the carvings.&lt;/p&gt;

Borobudur town was a 1.5 hour drive from Yogyakarta airport. A quiet town, with hot and dry weather — we seemed to come at height of the dry season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sea/assets/img-java/tofu-balls.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Drying racks of tofu balls&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Drying racks of tofu balls&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our second day we were ready to explore on a moped. We toured a small tofu factory and were treated with some fried tofu balls that were being turned inside out to be dried and prepared as bagged snacks. This was next to a tobacco factory, with giant piles of shredded tobacco. The tobacco plants grow very well in the dry season, and were seen growing in fields all over. When dry season finishes, there are two seasons for growing rice. Throughout Indonesia it’s our experience that nearly every man smokes, women rarely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sea/assets/img-java/tobacco.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tobacco&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Mountain of Tobacco&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We skeptically joined a guided tour by horse carriage. The three of us played some simple gamelan in a music classroom, ate some local treats and learned more about the history of the region from our guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside Bali our food options have become more limited. Along streets you can see signs for &lt;em&gt;warungs&lt;/em&gt; (the word for a small family restaurant or cafe in Indonesia) which prepare food for buffet style (or usually point-and-eat) items to eat usually with white rice. In Java, there were fewer non-spicy options. Asa’s spice tolerance has increased marginally, and Kanako can have a little bit, while my tolerance has increased a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, we’ve remained very healthy, though the first morning in Borobudur Asa and Kanako toured the farm animals around the guest house — Asa had fun feeding the cows — but they soon fled after being attacked by fleas. The fleas were tenacious and left Kanako with a number of bites, Asa not so bad.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">After leaving Bali we spent a week and half in Java (4 nights in Borobudur, 4 nights in Yogyakarta).

Now it’s been just over 2 months since we left Japan, most of that spent in Bali. Feels much longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For convenience and to greatly lower our expenses we decided to rent a moped for getting around Ubud. It wasn’t an easy decision, since we were hesitant especially traveling with a 3-yr old. So we made sure we had protection. Helmets, sunglasses, face masks (for the smoke and exhaust), and long-sleeve shirts (for the sun).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mopeds seem to own the streets here, gliding through traffic in all directions like salmon navigating a rushing river. Cars,  taxis, and trucks get stuck everywhere with a minimum of traffic lights on the island — and pedestrians fare no better. My time riding a moped in the Dominican Republic 15 years ago came in handy. Asa, hesitant at first, eventually warmed up to it. To ride a moped in Bali is to see and move through life like a local — later we learned that this is basically everywhere in Southeast Asia, from cities to rural farmlands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a little scary at first, I think more so in Bali than other places on our trip. Of course it’s not without risks. We saw many ambulances, mostly in the evenings carrying careless drunk tourists, or the ones they ran into. We rarely rode the moped after dark. After getting used to new environs,  I usually tried to ride like a local at the speed of traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sea/assets/img-ubud/tamblingan-temple.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Water temple at Lake Tamblingan&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Water temple at Lake Tamblingan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 weeks ago we rode the moped about 2 hours drive up the mountains to pass by three lakes (Bratan, Buyan and Tamblingan) to stay in Munduk, a small mountain town. On our way back to Ubud we stopped and at lunch in Jatiluwih, a world heritage site (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Tabanan_Regency#/Jatiluwih&quot;&gt;Tabanan Regency - Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;), famous for its endless span of rice field terraces covering every square meter. Overall it was a very pleasant drive through farmlands, up and down some steep mountain roads. The brakes were getting a little overheated, which led to a couple scary spots.  But then I figured out a better way to brake by alternately pumping the front and rear brakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sea/assets/img-ubud/jatiluwih.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Jatiluwih&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Rainy day at Jatiluwih&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ceremonies&quot;&gt;Ceremonies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week (late September) was a time of many ceremonies in Bali. Kanako and I spent a day at our previous guest house in central Ubud. The family invited us to come see the house blessing ceremony. On their relatively small property they hosted hundreds of family, extended family, friends and neighbors. Lunch and treats for everyone, as well as performances from a gamelan ensemble, an entertaining Topeng dancer (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Topeng&quot;&gt;Topeng - Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;) and a one-man puppet theater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small ceremonial house was built on their property, and was the centerpiece for the rites of the ceremony, much of it a mystery to us. But the basic idea is to purify the recent houses they have constructed so that they will actually come alive — that is, with an animistic spirit inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sea/assets/img-ubud/cremation-ceremony.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cremation ceremony&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Cremation ceremony in Pengosekan, Ubud&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple days later we attended the cremation ceremony held in the neighborhood we are staying. Special cow statues were constructed of wood, and placed on platforms that strong men paraded around the streets with a loud percussion band. Later the exhumed bodies of a dozen people, all deceased within the last couple years, were placed inside the cows. The cows were then carefully set on fire with gas torches. The cow eventually starts to crumble, and when the body falls through belly of the burning cow the spirit is released and is allowed to ascend to heaven. Or anyway, that’s about as much as I understood.&lt;/p&gt;

Ubud was a very different experience from our time in Canggu in July – different in good ways. Though Ubud is far from the beach, the streets are a little more manageable, and Ubud and the surrounding region has a big arts / crafts scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sea/assets/img-ubud/mountains.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mountains&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Mountain view from our guest house&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traffic is more congested in Ubud – though it was the high season, I kept wondering how can it possibly withstand more congestion in the coming years? It’s a swarm of two-wheeled vehicles with the cars / taxis pushing through at a slow pace. Our first week in Ubud we were staying in the center of town and we mostly walked, but occasionally relied on taxis. Uber is available in some areas of Bali, but is quite restricted because local taxi groups threaten Uber drivers (because they drive down prices). But we had many interesting conversations with taxi drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Temples are a common site. However, with or without Balinese inside, they often don’t seem welcoming to foreigners. All seem to be made of stone, much of it comes from local quarries. There is one river quarry along the river outside of Ubud, where I’ve seen stacks and stacks of the stones they use like bricks. This stone, usually dark gray, is soft, ideal for carving the ornate and intricate stone decorations that are ubiquitous in Bali.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, every residence seems to have a temple or shrine, size varies by wealth and property size. At both places we stayed in Ubud, the property’s temple had to reconstructed and raised on platforms because they had built 2-story buildings for guests. The temple should be higher than everything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sea/assets/img-ubud/canang.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Common canang offering&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Common canang offering&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small offerings (canang sari) are prepared everyday and everywhere – once blessed they are placed ceremonially at the entrance of every business, home, school, temple, etc. They are a huge part of daily life in Bali. The offerings usually consist of a small base of coconut leaves stitched together, with flowers of different colors placed on top, and finely cut leaves from a Pandan tree, then incense, and whatever else is appropriate for the occasion (rice, crackers, once I saw a dead baby chick). A reminder that aily rituals are very visible – practices that seem to bind the Balinese in cultural unity, keeping them distinct from the rest of Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aug 17, was Indonesian Independence Day (that is independence from the Dutch soon after Japan surrendered in WWII, or well it’s a little more complicated than that). Red and white flags, many of them quite large, were placed along roadsides in front of houses. We weren’t sure what would be closed, so we went for a gentle hike in the rice fields north of Ubud. There are extensive terraces of rice fields that have become a regular attraction for tourists. It is a stark contrast to walk a few hundred meters from fancy shops (Polo Ralph Lauren, Starbucks, resorts, etc.) and suddenly you are surrounded by rice fields. Much of the rice we saw was still young and green, many weeks before harvest. Here and there owners have built on or sold a plot of land to make a homestay (a small bungalow for paying guests – many are cheap, but still nicer than you might expect).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sea/assets/img-ubud/ricefield.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ricefield walk&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Ricefield walk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;food&quot;&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Ubud and Canggu, there were lots of western or western-influenced restaurants, but local food was around if you looked for it. It can be very cheap to eat like a local. I regularly ate a simple Indonesian-style lunch (a mountain of rice, some veggies, tempe, boiled egg and maybe a small piece of chicken or fish, and a healthy spoonful of spicy chili sauce) for 13,000 IDR = $1. The same fare is available for breakfast and dinner. If you spend a little more you can a little more variety. But food in Bali was a little more expensive than we expected. When eating out, for three of us we would on average spend about 140,000 IDR (about $10).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent one rainy Saturday morning doing a cooking class. Before getting to the cooking part we went to the big Ubud market with the guide to see where and how to buy certain things, produce etc.. Though it always feels silly for me being in a group of tourists, it was a fun class with 10 other people, and we enjoyed our food for lunch. Highlights from the menu:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ayam soto (chicken soup)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;coconut curry with tofu&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sayur urab (sprouts and green beans seasoned with dried coconut, and a variety of spices)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sate lilit (spiced and mashed meat grilled on sticks – we had with fish, but usually it is chicken)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sweet peanut sauce&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sambal matah (condiment of onion, ginger and more than I remember)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;tempe fried in sweet soy sauce (Asa’s favorite)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pandan crepe filled with shredded coconut and palm sugar for dessert (Asa’s real favorite)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sea/assets/img-ubud/bali-food.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Balinese cooking class&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Food from our Balinese cooking class&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other common Indonesian foods are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;nasi goreng (fried rice, often with a fried egg on top)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;mie goreng (fried egg noodle)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;bihun goreng (fried rice noodle)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;nasi campur (a variety of small dishes, meat, tempe, vegetables served with rice)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ayam kare (chicken curry)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;gado gado (veggies with peanut sauce, usually with potatoes, rice or noodles)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these dishes were delicious. Some seasoned for tourist tastes, but many places we went were just for locals. My tolerance for spicy food has started to ratchet up, but my wife and son haven’t caught up.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Returning to Bali, after a short trip to Kuala Lumpur we spent 5 weeks in Ubud.

We chose Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia for a 1-week getaway, which was the cheapest place to fly from Denpasar. (Also, after leaving Indonesia in October, we spent another week in Kuala Lumpur before going north to Penang).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sea/assets/img-kl/skyline.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;KL Skyline&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kuala Lumpur (or just “KL”) really felt like the hub of lower Southeast Asia. More developed and greater infrastructure than I imagine in Jakarta, but also with a very vibrant and visible mix of cultures. The city, like Malaysia as a whole, has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Immigration_to_Malaysia&quot;&gt;long history of migration&lt;/a&gt; (pre-colonial, colonial and modern) from throughout Asia: South Asian, East Asian, Minangkabau (West Sumatra), Borneo and many other places as well as “indigenous” groups. Religious sites and practices are on full display, from Buddhist and Hindu temples to the calls-to-prayer from mosques. Due to its wealth and infrastructure, Kuala Lumpur continues to attract people for study or work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We attended a dance exhibition for tourists (at the Malaysia Tourism Centre) featuring dances from the different cultures of Malaysia… Indian, Chinese, Borneo, Sarawak, Portuguese, etc. The finale ended with a song/dance with lyrics “Malaysia… the essence of Asia, the true Asia—“. The finale dance itself was a fusion of different modern and traditional influences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The refrain, despite being a ridiculous statement, nevertheless struck me as somewhat true. Indonesia, like Malaysia, is an aggregation of many regional cultures. Malaysia, and especially KL at the heart, is the more compact form. I wonder how will this compare to other places we will see?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sea/assets/img-kl/petronas.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Petronas Towers&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Petronas Towers (ie. KL Twin Towers)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed in a large high rise (reasonable Airbnb) a few blocks from the famous buildings: KL Tower (looks like Seattle space needle or Tokyo’s Sky Tree); and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Petronas_Towers&quot;&gt;KL twin towers&lt;/a&gt;, the tallest building in the world once upon a time.  High rises were everywhere, but there are still pockets of neighborhoods with small houses that have so far survived the development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used Uber a lot in KL, as do many locals. There seemed to be a hundred or so Uber drivers idling outside the airport waiting for their phones to chime. In the city center, we made good used of the free hop-on/hop-off buses (though the bus service map was a confusing failure in design). KL, despite being a large developed metropolis, is still part of Southeast Asia, so it’s really not pedestrian-friendly, and sometimes you feel like you need to hail an Uber just to cross a busy street with no pedestrian crossing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to Indonesia, prices are little higher in Malaysia. But the Malaysian Ringgit (RM), is more manageable than the Indonesia Rupee (IDR). $1 = 4 RM, $1 = 13,000 IDR. We roamed around some big markets and streets, the highlight was Kampung Baru. Also people-watching in the Chinatown, Little India, Little Pakistan areas. Food was overflowing with flavor, and mostly good — the unremarkable ones were  a result of poor choice of restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But to save money we took advantage of our full kitchen to cook a lot. Buying groceries was a challenge without a car, and more challenging on my wallet than expected. Malls were everywhere, everywhere, everywhere. The most common reason for tourism is shopping.  So if that is your thing, then you can fly across the world to shop at Gucci, or H&amp;amp;M, or Polo, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">After Canggu, we were still wanted more time in Bali, but for visa reasons we had to exit Indonesia before coming back. We chose Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia for a 1-week getaway, which was the cheapest place to fly from Denpasar. (Also, after leaving Indonesia in October, we spent another week in Kuala Lumpur before going north to Penang).</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Canggu, Bali, Indonesia</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/sea/2017/08/01/canggu.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Canggu, Bali, Indonesia" /><published>2017-08-01T00:00:00+07:00</published><updated>2017-08-01T00:00:00+07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/sea/2017/08/01/canggu</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/sea/2017/08/01/canggu.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sea/assets/img-canggu/beach.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Canggu beach&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Echo Beach at Canggu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 3 months in Japan from mid-Spring to mid-Summer, we took off for our real adventure. Our first stop: Bali, Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately out of the airport and taxi negotiated we blazed through roads streaming with cars, small trucks and mostly lots of mopeds. It was dizzying. Locals drive fast whenever they can, and many tourists try to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After navigating ever narrower roads occasionally passing small rice fields we arrived at our villa  in Canggu (pronounced “chang-gu”). Canggu is on the southeast coast of Bali, where we spent all of July. Kanako attended a yoga teacher training 6-days a week, while Asa and I explored the area. A couple days a week, Asa attended a small informal school tailored to international kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We mostly explored on foot — no longer a common form of transportation for locals (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/20/world/asia/jakarta-walking-study-sidewalks.html&quot;&gt;see this&lt;/a&gt;). So the narrow roads and speedy drivers are not so accommodating to pedestrians, sidewalks were rare. We trudged on, slowly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rice fields and resorts. Clearly a growing imbalance of agriculture and tourism. There were pockets of construction everywhere in Canggu, from a mega-resort due to finish in a couple years to small shops, and growing villas. It’s a sign of immense change to the area due to regular tourism from everywhere, but mainly Australia and Europe. While we are perpetually tourists on this trip, most of the tourists in Canggu we saw roam around like they own the place, and I got pretty tired of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the skies we could see kites everywhere. Some were ghostly kites made of garbage bags and bamboo, other kites much fancier in animal shapes, birds, dragons, butterflies, small to quite large; usually very very high in the sky, rain or sun, day and night. Weather was a little hot and humid but not unpleasant. Unfortunately the Canggu beach was not good for swimming, only for surfers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sea/assets/img-canggu/panobeach.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Canggu beach&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Old Man Beach at Canggu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout first week we were regularly reminded of the foreignness of Bali. We found a small scorpion in our room, menacing snakes on the road, centipedes. Asa was most concerned about the dogs, who held territories in packs along the roads. In our villa compound there were three dogs (Cookie, Caramel, and Cookies &amp;amp; Cream — we made up some names) that truly frightened Asa at the start. After a couple weeks he became friendly with them, though still wary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;life-in-bali&quot;&gt;Life in Bali&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Balinese are a lovely and friendly people, with welcome smiles and eager to converse in whatever English they know, which can be a little or a lot. They are also very affectionate with children, sometimes it can feel a little creepy… Asa being smothered with hugs and kisses by our young male waiter during dinner. Later we learned that children are considered to be sacred, perhaps in a way closer to the gods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Definitely I expect there are a lot similarities to India, since Bali is very Hindu religiously / culturally. After killing the scorpion in our room I felt I might have offended the staff when I told them. There are many temples and small shrine around that we’re interested in exploring but the locals don’t seem so welcoming for these places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is evidence everywhere of the emphasis on crafts and decorations. Shops selling furniture, statues giant and tiny, shrines and a variety of building materials. Materials must be pretty cheap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;outside-of-canggu&quot;&gt;Outside of Canggu&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Sunday we took a taxi to Seminyak, a neighboring beach town, but much bigger than Canggu. Overridden with fancy shops, and overly congested with traffic. But I guess it was worth walking around and exploring. As a pedestrian, how do you cross streets that have no traffic signals or street signs, racing mopeds on the sidewalks, cars and trucks speeding along? Patiently and carefully, especially with a 3-year old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sea/assets/img-canggu/taman-ayun.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Taman Ayun temple&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Taman Ayun temple&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also spent a half-day exploring the large Taman Ayun temple, located in what feels like the middle of the island, far from the beach but not quite in the mountain highlands. It was once an important water temple providing purifying water to farmers and for other important rituals. It was an interesting site, but like most Balinese temples, the inner complex is walled off to outsiders. So you are limited to observe over the wall to see the temple structures and imagine what it must have been like to use the space a couple hundred years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we explored Alas Kedaton, a smaller temple complex in a forest of tall straight trunked trees well-populated by macaques. The monkeys are the main highlight for visitors. Temple guides approach visitors and with bananas or nuts encourage the monkeys to climb on top of you for a quick picture.&lt;/p&gt;

It took months of thought, planning and convincing (ourselves and each other) just to be ready to get on the plane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;konnichiwa&quot;&gt;Konnichiwa&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But actually the first part of the adventure was to spend a few months in Japan to spend some time with family and in-laws. Before settling in Tokyo we spent a couple weeks doing tour through Kyoto, Kanazawa, a short stay at a ryokan in Noto, and an old style house in Gokayama. Kanako and I also spent a few days down in Fukuoka meeting friends and getting a taste of a more relaxed life compared to the rush of Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But our 2.5 months in Tokyo was special for all of us. We stayed in Adachi district, outside the craziness of central Tokyo, but an easy subway ride to wherever we needed to go. Asa went to a nearby preschool, and enjoyed time with grandparents, especially Kanako’s father’s cooking. Kanako prepared for her yoga teacher training in Bali. I did my freelance work, practiced my Japanese, and experienced life as a temporary ex-pat (i.e. migrant). It was a useful transition time for us to get ready for the challenges of being without a real home of our own for the next several months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early July, we said, &lt;em&gt;Sayounara&lt;/em&gt; and boarded a plane for Denpasar, Bali. Our plan, only roughly sketched out at the time, was a several month journey through Southeast Asia. Where would we go? How long would the trip take? What would happen when we finished? This collection of dispatches captures some of the experiences we had along the way.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">After 8 amazing years, we said one last “aloha” to friends and our home in Honolulu, packed almost all our stuff up and shipped it to the west coast.
