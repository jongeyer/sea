      <p>After 2 days of temples we settle in Yogyakarta, known as a city of education for all things traditionally Javanese (music, theater, textiles, etc.). We didn’t venture to any of the many universities, but we did see many young people in central Yogya where we were staying.</p>

<p>The city is also the capital of the Special Region of Yogyakarta — special, because it has a sultan. The sultanate existed apparently since prehistory, and survived the waves of European colonization and Indonesian independence. When independence was declared, the Sultan expressed his allegiance and in return was granted a special status. We visited the Sultan’s palace, a large estate suffering in disrepair, but preserving some interesting elements of history.</p>

<p>Yogya is a big city, with few visible Western tourists. Although more walkable than much of Bali, the city center is full of exhaust fumes hovering in the hot air. We walked the main thoroughfare (Jalan Malioboro) down to the local market area, which is absolutely packed with hundreds or thousands of vendors mostly selling batik clothing or other clothing. After some hours it’s dizzying to take in all the patterns, materials, of different sizes and purposes, etc. The true central market is a maze of stalls stocked from floor to ceiling in endless batiks.</p>

<p>We spent two evenings enjoying traditional Javanese theater. The first, Ramayana Ballet, overpriced and of mediocre quality was nevertheless intriguing. The same Ramayana story presented in the reliefs of Prambanan. The second, traditional puppet theater, also telling the story of Ramayana. The puppet theater was underpriced and quite enjoyable. The performance is led by a single puppeteer who sets the pace for the ensemble of musicians to follow. The puppeteer also has some musical methods to control the tension of the scene (like tapping a wooden box, or using one of his feet to chime a cymbal.</p>

<p><img src="/sea/assets/img-java/puppet-theater.jpg" alt="Puppet theater in Yogyakarta" />
<em>Puppet theater in Yogyakarta</em></p>

<p>The puppet performance had a curious mix of the serious focus of a sacred ritual and the casual atmosphere of performing with friends. Some of the musicians waved at Asa, and one invited a young woman to sit and play the instrument with him. This kind of mixed atmosphere was one I had seen in many performances through out Indonesia. Overall, it made things more enjoyable.</p>

<em>Aerial shot of Borobudur</em></p>

<p>On our 3rd day in Borobudur we visited the temple (Candi), which is why the town exists. The temple has <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Borobudur">a fascinating history</a> and is the largest Buddhist temple in the world, despite being located for many centuries in a region that is predominantly Muslim with virtually no Buddhists. At the time of its construction in the 9th century, Buddhists and Hindus were coexisting in central Java with some degree of harmony. (Candi Prambanan, we visited on the next day, is largest Hindu temple in Indonesia, built around the same time and only 50 km away). When a volcano erupts, the Javanese have the custom to pack up and pick a different place to live (seems like common sense); this happened in the 10th century so they abandoned Borobudur and Prambanan (both covered in volcanic ash and toppled) and settled mostly in Eastern Java to build new temples and start over. In the 19th century both sites were “rediscovered”, thus gaining international attention.</p>

<p><img src="/sea/assets/img-java/borobudur.jpg" alt="Stonework at Borobudur" />
<em>Stonework at Borobudur</em></p>

<p>Borobudur temple, has 9 levels, constructed like a step pyramid. These levels are broken into sections representing realms of Buddhist cosmology, and 1,460 relief sections surrounding the levels tell stories of the stages of the Buddha’s spiritual development to enlightenment. Aside from the reliefs, the temple has 504 life-size statues of Buddha geometrically arranged, and those on top veiled in stupas. Truly an impressive sight, and difficult to capture with my camera. Much work has been done to restore the structure, and the reliefs and other stonework have retained a lot of detail over a millennia.</p>

<p><img src="/sea/assets/img-java/borobudur-relief.jpg" alt="Stonework at Borobudur" />
<em>Example of relief at Borobudur</em></p>

<p>As the morning grew late, the sun was more intense and the tourists and visitors packed in tighter. In spite of its Buddhist symbolism, Borobudur is a revered as a source of pride for all Indonesians. We saw many Indonesians school groups flood the area.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Prambanan">Prambanan temple</a> was our stop on the next day, on our way to our next guest house in Yogyakarta. The biggest Hindu temple in Indonesia, Prambanan was also quite impressive. In contrast to the singular structure of Borobudur (and it’s “non-theistic” Buddhist values), Prambanan is a temple compound of several related temples, mainly to the principal Hindu gods, Shiva (destroyer), Brahma (creator) and Vishnu (preserver). Inside each temple was one or more cave-like rooms, each with a statue inside representing the god or lesser gods in relation. The complex of temples is meant to represent the layers of Hindu cosmology.</p>

<p>While based on different fundamental ideas, there seemed to be many similarities to Borobudur temple. There were reliefs around each temple, collectively telling the story of <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Ramayana">Ramayana</a> especially important in Indonesia and throughout Southeast Asia. Shapes and stone carving styles seemed quite similar as well. I enjoyed just examining the details and textures of the carvings.</p>

      <p>After leaving Bali we spent a week and half in Java (4 nights in Borobudur, 4 nights in Yogyakarta). Borobudur town was a 1.5 hour drive from Yogyakarta airport. A quiet town, with hot and dry weather — we seemed to come at height of the dry season.</p>

<p><img src="/sea/assets/img-java/tofu-balls.jpg" alt="Drying racks of tofu balls" />
<em>Drying racks of tofu balls</em></p>

<p>Our second day we were ready to explore on a moped. We toured a small tofu factory and were treated with some fried tofu balls that were being turned inside out to be dried and prepared as bagged snacks. This was next to a tobacco factory, with giant piles of shredded tobacco. The tobacco plants grow very well in the dry season, and were seen growing in fields all over. When dry season finishes, there are two seasons for growing rice. Throughout Indonesia it’s our experience that nearly every man smokes, women rarely.</p>

<p><img src="/sea/assets/img-java/tobacco.jpg" alt="Tobacco" />
<em>Mountain of Tobacco</em></p>

<p>We skeptically joined a guided tour by horse carriage. The three of us played some simple gamelan in a music classroom, ate some local treats and learned more about the history of the region from our guide.</p>

<p>Outside Bali our food options have become more limited. Along streets you can see signs for <em>warungs</em> (the word for a small family restaurant or cafe in Indonesia) which prepare food for buffet style (or usually point-and-eat) items to eat usually with white rice. In Java, there were fewer non-spicy options. Asa’s spice tolerance has increased marginally, and Kanako can have a little bit, while my tolerance has increased a lot.</p>

<p>Still, we’ve remained very healthy, though the first morning in Borobudur Asa and Kanako toured the farm animals around the guest house — Asa had fun feeding the cows — but they soon fled after being attacked by fleas. The fleas were tenacious and left Kanako with a number of bites, Asa not so bad.</p>

      <p>Having heard news that Agung volcano was rumbling, it seems to be the right time to say goodbye to Bali. Now it’s been just over 2 months since we left Japan, most of that spent in Bali. Feels much longer.</p>

<p>For convenience and to greatly lower our expenses we decided to rent a moped for getting around Ubud. It wasn’t an easy decision, since we were hesitant especially traveling with a 3-yr old. So we made sure we had protection. Helmets, sunglasses, face masks (for the smoke and exhaust), and long-sleeve shirts (for the sun).</p>

<p>Mopeds seem to own the streets here, gliding through traffic in all directions like salmon navigating a rushing river. Cars,  taxis, and trucks get stuck everywhere with a minimum of traffic lights on the island — and pedestrians fare no better. My time riding a moped in the Dominican Republic 15 years ago came in handy. Asa, hesitant at first, eventually warmed up to it. To ride a moped in Bali is to see and move through life like a local — later we learned that this is basically everywhere in Southeast Asia, from cities to rural farmlands.</p>

<p>It’s a little scary at first, I think more so in Bali than other places on our trip. Of course it’s not without risks. We saw many ambulances, mostly in the evenings carrying careless drunk tourists, or the ones they ran into. We rarely rode the moped after dark. After getting used to new environs,  I usually tried to ride like a local at the speed of traffic.</p>

<p><img src="/sea/assets/img-ubud/tamblingan-temple.jpg" alt="Water temple at Lake Tamblingan" />
<em>Water temple at Lake Tamblingan</em></p>

<p>2 weeks ago we rode the moped about 2 hours drive up the mountains to pass by three lakes (Bratan, Buyan and Tamblingan) to stay in Munduk, a small mountain town. On our way back to Ubud we stopped and at lunch in Jatiluwih, a world heritage site (<a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Tabanan_Regency#/Jatiluwih">Tabanan Regency - Wikipedia</a>), famous for its endless span of rice field terraces covering every square meter. Overall it was a very pleasant drive through farmlands, up and down some steep mountain roads. The brakes were getting a little overheated, which led to a couple scary spots.  But then I figured out a better way to brake by alternately pumping the front and rear brakes.</p>

<h2 id="ceremonies">Ceremonies</h2>
<p>Last week (late September) was a time of many ceremonies in Bali. Kanako and I spent a day at our previous guest house in central Ubud. The family invited us to come see the house blessing ceremony. On their relatively small property they hosted hundreds of family, extended family, friends and neighbors. Lunch and treats for everyone, as well as performances from a gamelan ensemble, an entertaining Topeng dancer (<a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Topeng">Topeng - Wikipedia</a>) and a one-man puppet theater.</p>

<p>A small ceremonial house was built on their property, and was the centerpiece for the rites of the ceremony, much of it a mystery to us. But the basic idea is to purify the recent houses they have constructed so that they will actually come alive — that is, with an animistic spirit inside.</p>

<p><img src="/sea/assets/img-ubud/cremation-ceremony.jpg" alt="Cremation ceremony" />
<em>Cremation ceremony in Pengosekan, Ubud</em></p>

<p>A couple days later we attended the cremation ceremony held in the neighborhood we are staying. Special cow statues were constructed of wood, and placed on platforms that strong men paraded around the streets with a loud percussion band. Later the exhumed bodies of a dozen people, all deceased within the last couple years, were placed inside the cows. The cows were then carefully set on fire with gas torches. The cow eventually starts to crumble, and when the body falls through belly of the burning cow the spirit is released and is allowed to ascend to heaven. Or anyway, that’s about as much as I understood.</p>
